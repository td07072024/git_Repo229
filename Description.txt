True to its name, it is the largest extant ibis species. Adults are 102–106 cm (40–41.5 in) long and weigh about 4.2 kg (9.3 lb).[2][3] Among standard measurements, the wing chord is 52.3–57 cm (20.6–22.4 in), the tail is 30 cm (12 in), the tarsus is 11 cm (4.3 in) and the culmen is 20.8–23.4 cm (8.2–9.2 in). The adults have overall dark grayish-brown plumage with a naked, greyish head and upper neck. There are dark bands across the back of the head and shoulder area and the pale silvery-grey wing tips also have black crossbars. The beak is yellowish-brown, the legs are orange, and the eyes are dark red. Juveniles have short black feathers on the back of the head down to the neck, shorter bills and brown eyes.[2]

It has a loud, ringing call, frequently repeated around dawn or dusk, a-leurk a-leurk.
